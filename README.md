# Food Classification Methods
 This repository contains the source code for my Thesis in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The scope of this project is the employment of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques to deal with the complex problem of Food Categorization. Specifically, this project evaluates mainly two different classification techniques: the classification using the visual features of an image and the classification with the intermediate step of predicting a list of ingredients.
